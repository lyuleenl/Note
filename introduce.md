Ok,it is my turn,my name is yulei,My English name is Allen.I am from a small county town in hebei Province.
I major in computer,work for two years.In my spare time, my favourite things are listen to music ,expecially Jay I'm a big fan.Music can make me relax.And i enjoy share music with other.
I am very optimistic and easy to get along with. I have many friends. Teamwork spirit is very important in this age. I think if we want to make big achievement, itâ€™s very important to learn how to cooperate with other people.


The reason why i study English  is that i would like to get the job more easily in the future.



In the next three years, I hope that while harvesting good results, I can also harvest a few precious friendships!


I guess that's enough about me for today,thank you.
